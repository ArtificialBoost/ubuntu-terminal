# ubuntu-terminal
An about me page, designed as the ubuntu terminal

`ubuntu-terminal` is a simple yet elegant web page for a static about me page.
It was originally created for my personal about me page, however have decided to create a different one.
The implementation strives to be simple and free of unnecessary code.
